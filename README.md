# ⚶ Vesta Extended Relationships (Webtrees Custom Module)

This [webtrees](https://www.webtrees.net/) custom module provides an extended 'Relationships' chart. It also displays additional relationship information via the extended 'Families' tab, and the extended 'Facts and Events' tab.
The project’s website is [cissee.de](https://cissee.de).

### Features<a name="features"/>

* The extended relationship chart provides additional options for calculating reationships. Common ancestors are included in the relationship path.

* The module provides proper language-specific relationship names, currently for English, German, Slovak, and Dutch. Additional languages may be added on request, but note that this feature will finally be supported in the webtrees core code as well in the near future.
* In the extended 'Families' tab, the relationship to the default individual is displayed, as well as prior relationships between married individuals. The latter are calculated relative to the date of the marriage (to avoid the trivial relationship husband/wife), which allows us to show e.g. that someone married his brother's wife's sister.

* On the extended 'Facts and Events' tab, relationships to associated individuals are calculated similarly (relative to the date of the event).
* Most features are configurable via module administration.
* On the extended 'Facts and Events' tab, inverse associations and relationships are also displayed:

### Installation<a name="installation"/>

* Unzip the files and copy the contents of the modules_v4 folder to the respective folder of your webtrees installation. All related modules are included in the zip file. It's safe to overwrite the respective directories if they already exist (they are bundled with other custom modules as well), as long as other custom models using these dependencies are also upgraded to their respective latest versions.
* Enable the extended 'Families' module via Control Panel -> Modules -> All modules -> ⚶ Vesta Families.
* Enable the extended 'Facts and Events' module via Control Panel -> Modules -> All modules -> ⚶ Vesta Facts and Events.
* Enable the main module via Control Panel -> Modules -> All modules -> ⚶ Vesta Extended Relationships. After that, you may configure several options.
* Configure the visibility of the old and the extended 'Families' tab via Control Panel -> Modules -> Tabs (usually, you'll want to use only one of them. You may just disable the original 'Families' module altogether).
* Configure the visibility of the old and the extended 'Facts and Events' tab via Control Panel -> Modules -> Tabs (usually, you'll want to use only one of them. You may just disable the original 'Facts and Events' module altogether).
